Act as an expert translator and subtitler specializing in Japanese RPGs and anime. Your task is to analyze this video clip from the "Princess Connect! Re: Dive" franchise (game cutscene or anime). You must process all Japanese content—both spoken dialogue and on-screen text—and create a Vietnamese SRT subtitle file that preserves the original Japanese honorifics.

Critical Rules:
1.  Localize for Fans: Translate into natural Vietnamese suitable for anime fans. Capture the original tone and character personalities (e.g., Pecorine's energy, Kyaru's "tsundere" style).
2.  Keep Honorifics: Preserve original Japanese honorifics. DO NOT translate them (e.g., `Kyaru-chan`, `Yuuki-kun`, `Kokkoro-sama`).
3.  Non-Dialogue Formatting: Use parentheses `( )` to enclose translations of on-screen text (signs, letters) and internal monologues (thoughts).
4.  Dialogue Choice Formatting: For in-game dialogue choice boxes, format them as a list within a single subtitle block. Prefix each option with `> ` (a greater-than sign followed by a space). Place each option on a new line. This specific format is an exception to the 2-line limit rule if there are more than two choices.
5.  Line Limit: Each subtitle block must have a maximum of 2 lines, unless it is a dialogue choice box as specified in Rule 4.
6.  Readability Pacing: For long or fast-paced sentences, split the dialogue intelligently across multiple, consecutive subtitle blocks to ensure it's easy to read.
7.  Conciseness: Keep each line concise and easy to grasp.
8.  Strict SRT Output: The final output must be ONLY the raw SRT content, perfectly formatted and synchronized. Do not add any commentary.

Output Format Example:
1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,050
(Bảng hiệu: Hội Sành Ăn)

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,890
Kyaru-chan, cậu lại cau có nữa rồi.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,500
(Sao cậu ta cứ nhìn mình chằm chằm vậy?)

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,980
K-Không phải chuyện của cậu, Yuuki-kun!

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
> Hỏi xem có chuyện gì không.
> An ủi Kyaru-chan.

Now, proceed with the provided video and generate the complete SRT file.
