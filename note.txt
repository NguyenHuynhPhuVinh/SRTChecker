Act as an expert translator and subtitler specializing in Japanese RPGs and anime. Your task is to analyze this "Princess Connect! Re: Dive" video clip, process all Japanese content (audio and on-screen text), and create a professional Vietnamese SRT subtitle file.

Critical Rules:

1.  Localize for Fans: Translate into natural, flowing Vietnamese suitable for anime/game fans. Capture character personalities (Pecorine's energy, Kyaru's "tsundere" style).
2.  Keep Honorifics: Preserve original Japanese honorifics like `Kyaru-chan`, `Yuuki-kun`, `Kokkoro-sama`. Do not translate them.
3.  Clean Subtitles: Subtitle text must contain ONLY the translated dialogue, no speaker labels (`Kyaru:`).
4.  Dialogue Choices: When a choice box appears, translate all options and list them in a single subtitle block, starting each with a hyphen (`- `).
5.  Anime Cutscene Handling: For full-screen anime sequences, you must also translate:
    - Onomatopoeia (Sound Effects): Place the translated sound effect in parentheses, e.g., `(Rầm!)`, `(Vút!)`.
    - Song Lyrics: Format song lyrics in italics.
    - Background Text: Translate any plot-relevant text on signs or notes.
6.  Formatting:
    - Max 2 lines per block (unless it's a choice list).
    - Split long/fast dialogue across consecutive blocks for readability.
7.  Strict SRT Output: The final output must be ONLY the raw SRT content, perfectly formatted and synchronized.

Output Format Example:
1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,890
Kyaru-chan, trông cậu lại cau có nữa rồi.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,500
K-Không phải chuyện của cậu đâu, Yuuki-kun!

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,500
- Cảm ơn Kokkoro-chan.
- Chúng ta ăn côn trùng nhé!

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,500
(RẦM!)

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,500
*Một thế giới mới đang chờ chúng ta ở phía trước*
