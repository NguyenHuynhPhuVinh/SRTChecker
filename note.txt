Act as an expert translator and subtitler specializing in Japanese RPGs and anime. Your task is to analyze this video clip from the "Princess Connect! Re: Dive" franchise (game cutscene or anime). You must process all Japanese content—both spoken dialogue and on-screen text—and create a Vietnamese SRT subtitle file that preserves the original Japanese honorifics.

Critical Rules:
1.  Localize for Fans: Translate into natural Vietnamese suitable for anime fans. Capture the original tone and character personalities (e.g., Pecorine's energy, Kyaru's "tsundere" style).
2.  Keep Honorifics: Preserve original Japanese honorifics. DO NOT translate them (e.g., `Kyaru-chan`, `Yuuki-kun`, `Kokkoro-sama`).
3.  Non-Dialogue Formatting: Use parentheses `( )` to enclose translations of on-screen text (signs, letters) and internal monologues (thoughts).
4.  Dialogue Choice Formatting: For in-game dialogue choice boxes, format them as a list within a single subtitle block. Prefix each option with `> ` (a greater-than sign followed by a space). Place each option on a new line. This specific format is an exception to the 2-line limit rule if there are more than two choices.
5.  Line Limit: Each subtitle block must have a maximum of 2 lines, unless it is a dialogue choice box as specified in Rule 4.
6.  Readability Pacing: For long or fast-paced sentences, split the dialogue intelligently across multiple, consecutive subtitle blocks to ensure it's easy to read.
7.  Conciseness: Keep each line concise and easy to grasp.
8.  Strict SRT Output: The final output must be ONLY the raw SRT content, perfectly formatted and synchronized. Do not add any commentary.

Output Format Example:
1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,050
(Bảng hiệu: Hội Sành Ăn)

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,890
Kyaru-chan, cậu lại cau có nữa rồi.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,500
(Sao cậu ta cứ nhìn mình chằm chằm vậy?)

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,980
K-Không phải chuyện của cậu, Yuuki-kun!

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
> Hỏi xem có chuyện gì không.
> An ủi Kyaru-chan.

Now, proceed with the provided video and generate the complete SRT file.

Act as a hyper-vigilant, senior Quality Assurance (QA) specialist for subtitles. You have generated a Vietnamese SRT file for a "Princess Connect! Re: Dive" video. Your new, definitive task is to perform an exhaustive quality check on this file, addressing common but critical AI errors.

Follow this multi-layered verification checklist with extreme precision:
1. Structural & Timestamp Integrity Check:
- SRT Format: Verify every entry has the standard structure: index, timestamp, text.
- Timestamp Syntax: Ensure all timestamps use a comma for milliseconds (HH:MM:SS,ms) and the --> separator is correct.
- Timestamp Logic (Crucial):
    + Invalid Timing: Verify the start time is strictly less than the end time (start_time < end_time). An entry where start_time >= end_time is a critical failure.
    + Excessive Duration: Flag any single subtitle entry that remains on-screen for too long (e.g., more than 8 seconds). Long-duration subtitles must be broken into smaller, consecutive entries.

2. Synchronization & Contextual Accuracy Check (Highest Priority):
- This is the most critical check. You must perform a frame-by-frame re-analysis. For each subtitle entry, verify that the Vietnamese text is an accurate and direct translation of the dialogue spoken or text displayed within that exact time window.
- Actively hunt for synchronization errors, where the subtitle content is mismatched. For example, the text for scene B appearing during scene A. If a mismatch is found, you must find the correct text for that timestamp and place it there.

3. Content and Language Integrity Check:
- 100% Vietnamese: The subtitle text must be pure Vietnamese (quốc ngữ), with standard numbers and punctuation. No exceptions.
- Foreign Character Removal: Explicitly find and correct any remaining Japanese (Kanji, Kana), Chinese, or other non-Vietnamese characters.
- Artifact & Error Cleanup: Remove any OCR artifacts, encoding errors (��), or duplicate consecutive lines.

4. Readability and Line Length Check:
- Line Limit: No subtitle entry can exceed two lines.
- Length Limit: No single line should be excessively long (over ~45-50 characters).
- Correction Mandate: If a subtitle is too long or has too many lines, you MUST fix it by intelligently splitting it across two lines or breaking it into two separate, properly-timed subtitle entries.

5. Gap Analysis (Stricter):
- Threshold: Identify any time gaps longer than 2.5 seconds where no subtitles are present.
- Investigation: For each gap, re-analyze the video. If any audible dialogue or significant on-screen text was missed, you MUST translate and insert it as a new subtitle entry. If the gap is just music or action, it is intentional.

Output Instructions (Follow this logic strictly):
- IF you find ANY error from ANY check above (format, timestamp logic, synchronization, language, length, or missed content):
    + Do NOT list the errors.
    + Instead, regenerate and provide a single, complete, and fully corrected version of the entire SRT file. The output must be ONLY the raw SRT content.

- IF the SRT file passes ALL checks flawlessly:
    + Do NOT return the SRT file again.
    + Instead, provide a confirmation message in VIETNAMESE.

This message should state that the file is valid. If you identified any intentional gaps, briefly explain in Vietnamese what is happening in the video during those specific timecodes.
