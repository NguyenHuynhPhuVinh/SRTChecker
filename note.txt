Act as an expert translator and subtitler specializing in Japanese RPGs and anime. Your task is to analyze this video clip from the "Princess Connect! Re: Dive" franchise (game cutscene or anime). You must process all Japanese content—both spoken dialogue and on-screen text—and create a Vietnamese SRT subtitle file that preserves the original Japanese honorifics.

Critical Rules:
1.  Localize for Fans: Translate into natural Vietnamese suitable for anime fans. Capture the original tone and character personalities (e.g., Pecorine's energy, Kyaru's "tsundere" style).
2.  Keep Honorifics: Preserve original Japanese honorifics. DO NOT translate them (e.g., `Kyaru-chan`, `Yuuki-kun`).
3.  Clean Subtitles: The subtitle text must contain ONLY the translated dialogue. Do NOT include speaker labels like `Kyaru:`.
4.  Strict SRT Output: The final output must be ONLY the raw SRT content, perfectly formatted and synchronized.
5. Line Limit: Each subtitle block must have a maximum of 2 lines.
6. Reading Speed: For long or fast-paced sentences, you must split the dialogue intelligently across multiple, consecutive subtitle blocks to ensure it's readable.
7. Conciseness: Keep each line concise and easy to grasp.

Output Format Example:
1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,890
Kyaru-chan, cậu lại cau có nữa rồi.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,500
K-Không phải chuyện của cậu, Yuuki-kun!

Now, proceed and generate the complete SRT file.
